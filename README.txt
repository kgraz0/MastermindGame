Implementation of the Mastermind game using GUI. This version prints the computer's guess in console and attempts to guess the randomly generated pattern.

Knuth's algorithm (five-guess algorithm) was partly implemented to achieve this.

To run:
Compile Mastermind.java and run it

Simply press 'Next Computer Guess' button and monitor the output printed in console. There is a problem with the colours so I made sure to print it in console.
